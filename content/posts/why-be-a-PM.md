As a computer science major, many of my classmates choose to pursue careers as software engineers, which involve building products through code. While I find this field exciting and valuable, I personally feel that product management is even more captivating.

A product manager's primary goal is to design and oversee the development of a product. While coding skills are not required for this role, it's important for the product manager to understand the development process and work collaboratively with software engineers to ensure a successful outcome. This aligns with my life goal of evolving and contributing to the evolution of the world in some small way. I feel that product management is better suited to achieving this goal than software engineering, which tends to be more focused on coding.

One way to view the difference between these two roles is to imagine yourself as a product. The skills and capabilities you gain as a product manager can help you to become a better version of yourself. As a software engineer, the focus is primarily on coding.

In terms of contributing to the evolution of the world, I am drawn to the idea of determining which products to develop and what features to include. I'm interested in doing the right things rather than simply doing things right. This is a key aspect of product management that motivates me.

Another way to approach the question of why I want to be a product manager is to consider what qualities make a good product manager and whether those qualities resonate with me. To be a successful product manager, I need to:

1. Have values that align with the field in which I work. This means enhancing my empathy for different people, even those with values that differ from my own. Iâ€™m passionate about understanding the values of my users and empathize with them to understand their problems and develop effective solutions.
2. Be able to solve new problems and acquire cross-disciplinary knowledge, which requires ongoing learning. I'm passionate about expanding my knowledge and using it to solve problems for users.
3. Be familiar with and skilled in various methodologies related to logical thinking, communication, working, cognitive processes, and learning. I believe that these methodologies can be applied not only in my professional life but also in my personal life.

I like to think of product management as a pre-school class for CEOs. While product managers are responsible for the success of a particular product, CEOs are responsible for the success of the entire company. By honing my skills as a product manager, I hope to take on larger challenges in the future and bring more value to users.

Ultimately, the success of a product depends on more than just technology. For example, Chrome succeeded over Internet Explorer, and the iPhone surpassed Nokia, despite not being the first product of its kind. This suggests that product management plays a critical role in a product's success. I find this challenge exciting and believe that by pursuing a career in product management, I can evolve myself and develop products that are helpful to users.
