## Introduction

Influencing others without holding a position of authority can be a challenging task. However, it is not impossible. People are often more inclined to listen to someone who genuinely cares about them and their objectives, rather than someone who simply displays vast knowledge or strong logical thinking. In this article, we will explore techniques to influence others effectively without relying on authority, using an illustrative example from the world of insurance marketing in the 19th century.

## Understanding the Other Person

Instead of directly expressing your thoughts, it is often more effective to ask the other person questions. This approach allows you to better understand their needs and concerns, enabling you to tailor your message in a way that meets their objectives. As you listen, be mindful of the purpose of the conversation and the different roles you might play as a listener. There are four main purposes of listening:

1. Appreciation
2. Comprehension
3. Empathy
4. Evaluation

Confusion between empathy (3) and evaluation (4) can often lead to conflict. For instance, if someone shares their frustrations about work, they may not be looking for solutions right away. Instead, they might need someone to empathize with them and understand their feelings. Offering solutions prematurely can hinder the development of trust and rapport.

## The Art of Listening

When listening, it is crucial to identify your primary objective and focus on that throughout the conversation. Avoid confusing the goals of empathy and evaluation. By doing so, you create an environment in which the other person feels understood and valued. This approach ultimately opens the door for them to be more receptive to your thoughts and ideas.

## The Power of Understanding: A Historical Example

Sociologist Viviana Zelizer conducted a study on the marketing of insurance in the 19th century and found that women, often Fundamentalist Christians, saw insurance as a suspicious scheme that seemed like gambling. They preferred to trust in the power of prayer and believed that betting on their husband's death through insurance would provoke divine wrath.

The insurance industry then realized they needed to tailor their message to meet the concerns and beliefs of their target audience. Instead of trying to explain the intricacies of probability theory or the mechanics of the insurance business, salespeople started approaching wives with a more empathetic and emotionally resonant message. They would say, "I have a mission to help your husband protect you from beyond the grave. If something horrible were to happen to him, you know he would love and protect you if he could. I'm making it possible." This new sales pitch effectively addressed the women's concerns and made the concept of insurance more palatable to them.

## Takeaway

To effectively influence others without authority, always remember the importance of listening with a clear purpose in mind, empathizing with the other person, and understanding their concerns. The story of insurance marketing in the 19th century serves as an excellent example of how understanding others first can help you influence them more easily. By doing so, you will foster trust and rapport with the person you are trying to influence, allowing you to make a positive impact on their lives without relying on authority.
