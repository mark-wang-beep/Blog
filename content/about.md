**What do I value?**

1. Health.
2. Evolve (or learn).
<!-- 3. Be kind.
3. Respect myself.

The "Respect myself" one is for hedging with the "Be kind" one so that I am not excessively kind in a way that I don't respect myself.

What I mean by respecting myself is:

1. Be genuinely okay with who I am and to live my life accordingly.
2. Respect my own wants and needs. -->
